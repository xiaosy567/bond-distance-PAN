This three tcl scripts in for bond distance calculations.

work routine.

Main points:

Three scripts are presented. All aim the same purpose. >>>
calculates the bond distance as a function of the frames, for a series of bonds.

AA-LIST-distance.tcl >>>most efficient, and need "bond-aa-resid-name-list"
AA-LIST-distance.tcl.bak.1 >>>worse, do NOT need "bond-aa-resid-name-list"
AA-LIST-distance.tcl.bak.2 >>worst, do NOT need "bond-aa-resid-name-list"
AA-LIST-distance.tcl.bak.3 >> as good as AA-LIST-distance.tcl, do NOT need "bond-aa-resid-name-list"
